# Call Log #

Simple Call Log plugin for OpenVBX

Fork of [Victor Quinn's Call Log plugin](https://github.com/victorquinn/OpenVBX-Call-Log), which is a fork of [kressaty's Call Log plugin](https://github.com/kressaty/OpenVBX-Plugin-Call-Log).

Added a "Hangup" action to active calls.

Victor improved interoperability with his [SMS Log module](https://github.com/victorquinn/OpenVBX-SMS-Log).
